# vomiting_outbreak_uk_dogs
In early 2020, the Small Animal Veterinary Surveillance Network reported evidence of an outbreak of acute prolific vomiting in dogs in the UK. The aims of this study were to investigate whether there was evidence for a vomiting outbreak in Dogslife and Google Trends data and to describe its characteristics. This repository contains code for our statistical analysis of the data we collected.

 
The code contained in this repository is supplementary material for our publication (Woolley _et al_., 2021), which provides further details about the methodologies used.
